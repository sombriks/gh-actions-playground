# My gh-actions playground

Small examples of interesting GitHub actions combinations.

## How to run this playground

Most workflows where intentionally left with `workflow_dispatch` so they don't
run by accident on every commit. Not as if it was a big issue, since they do
_mostly nothing_ by design.

But you can also run them using the [act][0] command line tool, which emulates
the GitHub actions environment in a quite near the real thing way.

So, the three big ways to run a workflow:

- Visit [the actions page][1] and run them by hand
- Use the [GitHub CLI][2]: `gh workflow run .github/workflow/00-hello-world.yml`
- Use act: `act -W .github/workflows/00-hello-world.yml`

## Overview

GitHub Actions is what happens when yaml and bash decide to have a child.

The workflow files are used to common integration routines: run tests, check the
quality of code, perform any chore that can be automatized, scripted.

## Workflow file syntax

Each workflow file must define:

- _name_ (unique across all workflows)
- _on_ (event)
- _jobs_ (actual work)

### Events

What could possibly trigger an workflow?

- You hit a button
- A git push or something
- Another workflow

More possibilities [here][3].

### Jobs

- Give cool names to your jobs, not just _build_
- One workflow can house several jobs
- Jobs will run in **parallel** unless you do something about it
  - make jobs `needs` other jobs

More details [here][4].

## 00 - [smallest possible][5]

- [Manual dispatch][6]
- [Echoes 'hello world'][7]

![image-manual-dispatch.png][8]

## 01 - [occurs on every git push or merge][9]

- The 101 of CI
- [Echoes 'hello word from _some branch_'][10]

![image-on-push.png][11]

## 02 - [have two jobs][12]

- Remember, runs in [parallel][13]!
- Pretty much like two distinct workflows, but sharing rent of a workflow file

![two-jobs.png][14]

## 03 - [have two jobs but in sequence][15]

- Make sure the second [needs][16] the first

![job-needs.png][17]

## 04 - [make one job use another workflow][18]

- This is why [workflow_call][19] exists
- Don't misread as [workflow_dispatch][20], it's another thing
- Quite similar to what we do when [consuming actions from marketplace][21]

## 05 - [jobs inputs][23]

- Both `workflow_call` and `workflow_dispatch` can receive inputs
- Use [inputs][24] inside the steps inside jobs

![job-input.png][25]

## 06 - [jobs outputs][26]

- You can define [outputs values][27] so other jobs can check on
- For dynamic outputs check the `$GITHUB_OUTPUT` variable usage

![job-output.png][28]

## 07 - [environment variables][29]

- The repository itself can contribute with custom variables
- Use [GitHub CLI][2] to list, set or remove [repository variables][30]
- If using [act][0], create a `.vars` file to define variables
- With `act` there is also a `.env` file but we talk about it later

```bash
# ~/github/gh-actions-playground/.vars
X="some value from vars"
```

![repository-variables.png][31]

## 08 - [secrets][32]

- Very useful to interact with the world outside the repo
- Define secrets via web console settings
- Or use GitHub CLI to create them, pretty handy!
- With act, just put it inside a `.secrets` file!
- Note: **secret values are [not echoed][33] on logs**

```bash
# ~/github/gh-actions-playground/.secrets
X=10
MY_SECRET="not telling you!"
```

```bash
[sombriks@thanatos gh-actions-playground](main)$ gh secret set X
? Paste your secret **

âœ“ Set Actions secret X for sombriks/gh-actions-playground
```

## 09 - [steps][34]

- Simplest step is a `run` command
- Complex ones `uses` external actions from [marketplace][21]
- Give proper `names` for your steps

More details of what is possible [here][35]

## 10 / 11 - define outputs for reusable workflows

- Define a [reusable workflow][43] with an output section
- Define a workflow with a [job consuming the reusable][44]

More info [here][45] and [here][46].

## Noteworthy 3rd party actions

- This is why GitHub Actions it's better than other CI tools from other vendors
- Rich ecosystem

- [Java][36]
- [Node][37]
- [Docker][38]
- [AWS Actions][39]
- [Upload][40]
- [Download][41]
- [Checkout][42]

There's much, much more!

## Writing good CI/CD pipelines

- Run tests
- Publish packages or images
- For GitOps, update _desired state_ on IaC manifests files

## Conclusion

This playground is intended to be simple, educational.

It's up to you combine the techniques sampled here to build real things.
